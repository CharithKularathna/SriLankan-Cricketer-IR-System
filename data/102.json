As the best rated Sri Lankan player in run-chases in ODI history,[2] he is often regarded as one of the most innovative ODI batsmen of all time. Dilshan is considered to be a rare example of a cricketer with notable skills in all aspects of the game, who can bat, bowl, field and keep wicket. He is an aggressive right-hand batsman who invented the scoop, which has come to be known as the Dilscoop, a shot that hits the ball over the keeper. Apart from being an opening batsman, he is also a capable off-break bowler. Energetic in the field, he usually fields at the point region.[3]\n", "years": "1999\u20132016", "matches": 330, "runs_scored": 10290, "highest_score": "161*", "bat_avg": 39.27, "wickets": 106, "runs_conceded": 4778, "best_figures": "4/4", "ball_avg": 45.07, "catches_taken": 123}
