He had modelled his text book bowling action on Richard Hadlee and he was regarded as a huge fan of Hadlee.[5]\n", "years": "1986\u20131992", "matches": 44, "runs_scored": 249, "highest_score": "33", "bat_avg": 8.58, "wickets": 45, "runs_conceded": 1876, "best_figures": "5/57", "ball_avg": 41.68, "catches_taken": 8}
